# RAG-Gemma: Retrieval Augmented generation chatbot By Integrating Google Gemma 7B LLM, BAAI/bge-large-en, Langchain, ChromaDB, and Gradio

# Install Nightly Build
nvcc --version
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128
To use PyTorch with CUDA 12.8, install the latest nightly build:
install ipykernel
export JUPYTER_PATH=/mnt/c/LLM-ZERO-TO-HUNDRED/Open-Source-RAG-GEMMA/
source ~/.bashrc
jupyter kernelspec list
python -m ipykernel install --prefix="LLM-Zero-to-Hundred" --name=venv
export GEMMA_TOKEN=
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000


**The chatbot offers versatile usage through two distinct methods:**
1. **Offline Documents**: Engage with documents that you've pre-processed and vectorized. These documents can be seamlessly integrated into your chat sessions.
2. **Real-time Uploads:** Easily upload documents during your chat sessions, allowing the chatbot to process and respond to the content on-the-fly.

* The project provides guidance on configuring various settings, such as adjusting the Gemma model's temperature, top_p, and top_k for optimal performance.
* The user interface is designed with gradio, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
* For each response, you can access the retrieved content along with the option to view the corresponding PDF.

* NOTE: This project is currently set up as a **demo**. As such, the document management is simplified and not suitable for production environments.

## Document Storage
Documents are stored in two separate folders within the `data` directory:
- `data/docs_2`: For files that you want to **upload**.
- `data/docs`: For files that should be **processed in advance**.

## Server Setup
The `llm_serve.py` module uses FLask to run a **web server** that serves the LLM for real time inferencing.
The `reference_serve.py` module leverages these folders to create an **HTTPS server** that hosts the PDF files, making them accessible for user viewing.

## Database Creation
Vector databases (vectorDBs) are generated within the `data` folder, facilitating the project's functionality.

## Important Considerations
- The current file management system is intended for **demonstration purposes only**.
- It is **strongly recommended** to design a more robust and secure document handling process for any production deployment.
- Ensure that you place your files in the correct directories (`data/docs_2` and `data/docs`) for the project to function as intended.
pip install transformer flask gradio langchain pyprojroot chromadb pypdf pandas torch python-dotenv PyYAML
```

before running the chatbot execute:
```
python src\upload_data_manually.py
```
Then:
In Terminal 1:
```
python src\reference_serve.py
```

In Terminal 2:
```
python src\llm_service.py
```

In Terminal 3:
```
python src\app.py
```
